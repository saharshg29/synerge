                <h2>🎯 The Objective</h2>
                <p>Synerge is a collaborative game where players try to achieve perfect alignment. The goal is for **all players** in the room to choose the **exact same number** (from 1 to 10) in a single round.</p>

                <h2>🚪 Rooms & The Host</h2>
                <p>The player who creates a room is the **Host**. The Host controls when the game begins. Players can join a room using the unique 6-character code. The game requires a minimum of 2 players to start.</p>

                <h2>🔄 Game Rounds</h2>
                <p>The game is played in rounds. In each round:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every player secretly selects one number from 1 to 10.</li>
                    <li>Once everyone has locked in their choice, the numbers are revealed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Success:</strong> If all players chose the same number, synergy is achieved, and the game is won!</li>
                    <li><strong>Failure:</strong> If there is any mismatch, the round ends, and a new round begins automatically.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The game continues until your team achieves synergy.</p>

                <h2>🏆 Winning</h2>
                <p>When you win, the game shows how many rounds it took to succeed. The host then has the option to start a new game with the same group of players.</p>
